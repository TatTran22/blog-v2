# Privacy Policy

Welcome to Tat Tran's personal blog. Your privacy is of utmost importance to me, and this policy outlines how your information is collected, used, and protected when you interact with my blog.

## 1. Information Collection

- When you choose to comment or access my resume, you'll be prompted to log in. During this process, I may collect personal identifiers like your name and email address.
- I utilize Google OAuth 2.0 and Microsoft Azure for social logins, and you also have the option to register directly using an email and password.
- Comments are stored in Firebase, while Clerk manages user data. I personally do not store this data on any separate servers.

## 2. Cookies

- I don't actively use cookies on my blog. However, Clerk might employ cookies to manage authentication tokens.

## 3. Use of Your Information

- Your information is exclusively used to facilitate commenting and to grant access to my resume.
- Rest assured, I do not share, sell, or distribute your personal details to third parties.

## 4. Security Measures

- I prioritize your data's security and have implemented measures to safeguard your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
- While I strive for robust security, it's essential to note that no online platform is entirely secure. I encourage you to be cautious and ensure your account's security from your end as well.

## 5. Your Rights and Control

- You can access, modify, or delete your personal information at any time. To do this, simply navigate to the account management section and opt to delete your account.
- If you have concerns or questions about this privacy policy or your data, please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:your-email@example.com).

## 6. Updates to This Policy

- As my blog evolves, I might update this privacy policy to reflect changes. I recommend checking this section periodically for any updates.
